# Your Music Recommendation System ðŸŽ¶
Tailored specially for you! Discover music that matches your mood or find similar songs easily. ðŸŽ§

# Background
Mood is highly connected to music where emotional content has become an important factor affecting music selection today. This statement is supported by Bhosale et al. (2024) where most people listen to music that suits their current mood or helps them transition to a different mood.

Therefore, this shows how interconnected music and mood are, which leads to the idea of developing a music recommendation system based on mood prediction.

# Problem Statement
1. Existing models have low accuracy: Bhosale et al. (2024)'s research only achieve an accuracy of 0.76 for their models on test data.

2. Designing systems to recommend music that aligns with users' preferences is still limited.

# Project Objectives
1. To develop a mood prediction model

2. To evaluate a mood prediction model

3. To develop a music recommendation system based on mood prediction model
